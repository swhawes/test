    "text": "This example examines the question whether participants reported different mean levels of externalizing problems on the CBCL when measured at Baseline (T0) compared to when measured at the 1-Year follow-up (T1). This analysis is conducted in two primary steps: 1) computing a difference score (DiffScore = CBCL EXT T2 - CBCL EXT T1); 2) conducting a paired samples t-test on the difference score. Our primary aim is to determine whether average CBCL externalizing scores of the participants change from assessement 1 (T1) to assessement 2 (T2), while accounting for observations that are clustered within youth over time."
