[**The primary goal**]{style="color: goldenrod; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"} 
of the "how-to" section is on providing practical solutions to specific methods or analytic problems users might encounter. Unlike tutorials, which aim to teach a concept, how-to guides concentrate on the efficient execution of specific analyses without going into in-depth background explanations. By following these principles, the how-to section aims to create practical, efficient, and user-friendly guides that help users quickly identify solutions and accomplish their goals.

The how-to section should:

1. **Be problem-oriented**: How-to guides should address specific problems or analyses users may face, offering clear and concise solutions. Each guide should focus on a single issue, making it easy for users to find and apply the relevant information.

2. **Offer step-by-step instructions**: Similar to tutorials, how-to guides should provide a clear sequence of steps that users can follow to solve their problem or complete their analysis. Each step of the instructions should be explained in a straightforward manner.

3. **Be concise**: How-to guides should be to the point, offering just enough information to help users accomplish their goal. This means avoiding unnecessary explanations or background information, as users are typically looking for a quick solution.

4. **Be actionable**: The content in the how-to section should be practical, with a focus on actionable advice that users can apply immediately. This may involve providing code snippets, configuration settings, or other specific instructions that users can implement in their projects.

5. **Include examples**: How-to guides should include relevant examples that demonstrate the solution in action, allowing users to see how the instructions can be applied in a real-world context.

6. **Cross-reference other resources**: How-to guides should link to other relevant documentation, such as explanations or reference material, for users who may require additional background information or a deeper understanding of the topic.
