Given the complex nature of the longitudinal data collected in the ABCD Study, researcher are likely to encounter a myriad of methodological and analytic considerations and concerns. This review provides a comprehensive examination of key issues and techniques related to longitudinal data analysis, specifically focusing on the ABCD Study. The text discusses model assumptions, common violations (e.g., independent and identically distributed residuals, *heterogeneous* *variability*) and their implications for valid inference. The importance of appropriately modeling covariance structures, understandings trade-offs between model fit and parsimony, and challenges related to sample size, attrition, missing data are highlighted. Consideration is given to the importance of selecting appropriate statistical models to account for correlations in repeated measurements and the assumptions underlying these models. The review also differentiates between linear and non-linear models in the context of continuous and discrete data, emphasizing various distributional assumptions and the necessity of choosing appropriate models and statistical methods. By addressing these complexities, the review seeks to equip researchers with the necessary knowledge and tools to make informed decisions as they navigate effectively analyzing and interpreting data available in the ABCD Study.\nthanks: |\n  Placeholder text generated at <https://vlad-saling.github.io/star-trek-ipsum/>.\nadditional-info: |\n  We have no known conflict of interest to disclose.\nkeywords:\n  - ABCD Study\n  - longitudinal analyses\n  - development\ndate: April 30, 2023\nbibliography: references.bib\nformat:\n  hikmah-pdf: default\n  hikmah-manuscript-pdf: default\n---\n\n\n\nWe're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive me if I've said and listened to this a thousand times [@Lovelace:1842]. This planet's interior heat provides an abundance of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.\n\n# Main section\n\nIt indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem,  the entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy [@Turing:1936]. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='test_cache/pdf/unnamed-chunk-1_9f23a076a6406bc9f81c2a4dc0cf9f5a'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_lights <- 2 + 2\nn_lights\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAny device like that would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular polarization. I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter the photons with phase discriminators.\n\n$$\ny = \\text{Something} + \\beta_1 x_1\n$$\n\n## Subsection\n\nCommunication is not possible [@Keynes:1937].
