In this tutorial, we will walk you through a simple example using a simulated dataset and demonstrate how to fit a Growth Mixture Model using the `lcmm` package in R.\n\n[+add diagrams/figures]\n\n### When to use Growth Mixture Models (GMMs)?\nYou should use xxxxxxx in the following scenario:\n\n1.\tYou want to know xxxxx\n2.\tYour variable xxxxx\n3.\tYou have xxxxx \n\n### Getting Started with Growth Mixture Models (GMMs)\n\n#### Prerequisites\nTo follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer. Additionally, you will need to install the `lcmm` package, which provides functions for fitting Growth Mixture Models.\n\n## Basic Example \n\n::: {.cell hash='13_Tutorials_GrowthMixtureModels_cache/html/setup_f2ca9f11eaf461b91d0ad3fdcb7c01eb'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Install the lcmm package if not already installed\nif (!(\"lcmm\" %in% installed.packages())) {\n  install.packages(\"lcmm\")\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nLoad the lcmm package\n\n::: {.cell hash='13_Tutorials_GrowthMixtureModels_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_629d6e4f877056182dfb5b816a8137f8'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lcmm)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSimulating the Data\nFor this tutorial, we will use a simulated dataset with three growth trajectory classes, where each class represents a different pattern of change over time. The dataset will consist of 300 individuals with four repeated measurements (time points) for each individual.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='13_Tutorials_GrowthMixtureModels_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_c154a209b1ad6b1512318e854a335920'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(123)\nn <- 300\ntimepoints <- 4\n\n# Simulate the data for each class\nclass1 <- data.frame(id = 1:(n / 3),\n                     time = rep(1:timepoints, each = n / 3),\n                     class = 1,\n                     value = rnorm(n * timepoints / 3, mean = 1 + 0.5 * (1:timepoints), sd = 0.5))\n\nclass2 <- data.frame(id = (n / 3 + 1):(2 * n / 3),\n                     time = rep(1:timepoints, each = n / 3),\n                     class = 2,\n                     value = rnorm(n * timepoints / 3, mean = 2 - 0.3 * (1:timepoints), sd = 0.5))\n\nclass3 <- data.frame(id = (2 * n / 3 + 1):n,\n                     time = rep(1:timepoints, each = n / 3),\n                     class = 3,\n                     value = rnorm(n * timepoints / 3, mean = 3 + 0.1 * (1:timepoints), sd = 0.5))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='13_Tutorials_GrowthMixtureModels_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_14b119e343bbd5a3ab5eb68db91dc35e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Combine the data from all classes\ndata <- rbind(class1, class2, class3)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Model Specification and Estimation\nNow that we have our simulated data, we can fit a Growth Mixture Model. In this example, we will assume that there are three latent classes. However, in practice, the number of classes is usually unknown and must be determined through model comparisons or other methods.\n\n::: {.cell hash='13_Tutorials_GrowthMixtureModels_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_c36336380f113cb6549b47abbcc95362'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit the Growth Mixture Model\ngmm <- hlme(value ~ time,\n            random = ~ time,\n            subject = \"id\",\n            mixture = ~ time,\n            data = data,\n            ng = 3,\n            B = list(value = c(1, 0, 0, 0)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Interpreting the Results\nxxxxxx",
