This method extends the generalized linear mixed-effects model by modeling both fixed-effects (population-averaged effects) and random-effects (subject-specific deviations), while accounting for within-subject correlations. The method can handle unbalanced or unequally spaced data, and can accommodate various outcome distributions, including binary, count, and continuous data. GLMMs have been shown to have good statistical power and efficiency, and can be used to model complex data structures, including crossed and nested random effects. GLMMs have been shown to outperform other methods, such as GEE, in terms of statistical power and efficiency (Hardin & Hilbe, 2012).\n\n[+add diagrams/figures]\n\n### When to use Longitudinal Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models (GLMMs) Models?\nYou should use xxxxxxx in the following scenario:\n\n1.\tYou want to know xxxxx\n2.\tYour variable xxxxx\n3.\tYou have xxxxx \n\n### Getting Started with Longitudinal Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models (GLMMs)\n\nIn this tutorial, we will introduce the concept of longitudinal generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) and guide you through a simple example using a small dataset. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n\n1. Understand the basic concepts of longitudinal GLMMs.\n2. Fit a GLMM using example data in R.\n3. Interpret the results of the model.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nFor this tutorial, we will use a simple dataset containing the following information for a group of individuals:\n\n- Subject ID\n- Time (in years)\n- Binary outcome variable (e.g., presence or absence of a particular condition)\n\n| Subject ID | Time | Outcome |\n|------------|------|---------|\n| 1          | 0    | 0       |\n| 1          | 1    | 1       |\n| 1          | 2    | 1       |\n| 2          | 0    | 0       |\n| 2          | 1    | 1       |\n\n### Model Specification and Estimation\n\nWe will use the `lme4` package in R to fit a longitudinal GLMM. First, install the required package, if not already installed:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='7_Tutorials_GeneralizedLinearMixedEffectsModels_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_ce9ae29f5f5fa9c9c238b43e7b2ac07c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!(\"lme4\" %in% installed.packages())) install.packages(\"lme4\")\nlibrary(lme4)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, create a data frame with the example data:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='7_Tutorials_GeneralizedLinearMixedEffectsModels_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_6153e8f99c61932786358ac43f859c76'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- data.frame(\n  subject_id = factor(c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2)),\n  time = c(0, 1, 2, 0, 1),\n  outcome = c(0, 1, 1, 0, 1)\n)\n```\n:::\n\nFit the longitudinal GLMM with a binary outcome using a logit link function and random intercepts for each subject:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='7_Tutorials_GeneralizedLinearMixedEffectsModels_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_5154794411a17f3d64c6fc769136a35b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel <- glmer(outcome ~ time + (1 | subject_id), data = data, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Interpreting the Results\nTo interpret the results of the longitudinal GLMM, we can use the summary() function in R to display the estimated fixed effects and random effects:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='7_Tutorials_GeneralizedLinearMixedEffectsModels_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_98c7b26927367c59216da414df4c9c35'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(model)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nGeneralized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace\n  Approximation) [glmerMod]\n Family: binomial  ( logit )\nFormula: outcome ~ time + (1 | subject_id)\n   Data: data\n\n     AIC      BIC   logLik deviance df.resid \n     6.0      4.8      0.0      0.0        2 \n\nScaled residuals: \n      Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max \n-1.49e-08 -1.49e-08  1.49e-08  1.49e-08  1.49e-08 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups     Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n subject_id (Intercept) 0.36     0.6     \nNumber of obs: 5, groups:  subject_id, 2\n\nFixed effects:\n              Estimate Std.

By examining the odds ratio and its associated p-value, we can determine if the change in the outcome variable over time is significant at the population level. Additionally, the output will display information about the random effects, such as the variance of the random intercepts for subjects.",
