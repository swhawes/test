Latent Change Score Models allow researchers to examine individual differences in change over time, as well as the factors that might influence these changes. We'll walk through an example using a dataset with three time points and a larger sample size of 250 participants.\nxxx\n\n[+add diagrams/figures]\n\n### When to use Latent Change Score Models?\nYou should use xxxxxxx in the following scenario:\n\n1.\tYou want to know xxxxx\n2.\tYour variable xxxxx\n3.\tYou have xxxxx \n\n### Getting Started with Latent Change Score Models\n\n#### Prerequisites\nTo follow along with this tutorial, you'll need to have R installed on your computer, as well as the \"lavaan\" package for fitting latent variable models.\n\nYou can install the \"lavaan\" package using the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='9_Tutorials_LatentChangeScoresModels_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_3e237a13f7d5f3f27408567968a9358a'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!(\"lavaan\" %in% installed.packages())) {\n  install.packages(\"lavaan\")\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Basic Example\nFor this tutorial, we'll use a hypothetical dataset called \"data\" with the following variables:\n\nsubject_id: A unique identifier for each participant\nscore_t1: The measurement of a variable of interest at Time 1\nscore_t2: The measurement of the same variable at Time 2\nscore_t3: The measurement of the same variable at Time 3\nFirst, let's load the \"lavaan\" package and create a larger dataset for this example:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='9_Tutorials_LatentChangeScoresModels_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_08fc5b6b444c5e5e541746518f827303'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lavaan)\n\n# Create a sample dataset with 250 participants\nset.seed(42) # For reproducibility\nsubject_id <- 1:250\nscore_t1 <- rnorm(250, mean = 20, sd = 5)\nscore_t2 <- score_t1 + rnorm(250, mean = 2, sd = 3)\nscore_t3 <- score_t2 + rnorm(250, mean = 3, sd = 4)\ndata <- data.frame(subject_id, score_t1, score_t2, score_t3)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Model Specification and Estimation\nNow, let's specify the Latent Change Score Model. In this example, we'll estimate the mean change in the variable of interest from Time 1 to Time 2 and from Time 2 to Time 3, as well as the variances of the change scores.\n```\n\n::: {.cell hash='9_Tutorials_LatentChangeScoresModels_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_4c6ae3706e63906c93faa359ec254305'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define the Latent Change Score Model\nmodel <- '\n  # Latent variables\n    delta12 =~ 1 * score_t2 - 1 * score_t1\n    delta23 =~ 1 * score_t3 - 1 * score_t2\n\n  # Means\n    delta12 ~ mu_delta12\n    delta23 ~ mu_delta23\n\n  # Variances\n    delta12 ~~ var_delta12 * delta12\n    delta23 ~~ var_delta23 * delta23\n`\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='9_Tutorials_LatentChangeScoresModels_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_627ca6d70a43f255a25815b5fd2fbb36'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit the model\nfit <- sem(model, data = data, missing = \"FIML\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Interpreting the Results\nWe can now examine the results of our Latent Change Score Model. The main parameters of interest are:\n\nmu_delta12: The mean change in the variable of interest from Time 1 to Time 2\nmu_delta23: The mean change in the variable of interest from Time 2 to Time 3\nvar_delta12: The variance of the change scores from Time 1 to Time 2, which reflects individual differences in change\nvar_delta23: The variance of the change xxxx\n",
