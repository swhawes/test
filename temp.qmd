It is important to match a theory of change with design and statistical model to assess change. (p. 4)
Models with two time points cannot provide estimates of within-person change.
“Stability” over time can reflect many things, only some of which mean a lack of change. (p. 14)
It is helpful to describe not only average growth (e.g. intercept and slope means), but variances in the growth parameters. (p. 25)

Models that focus exclusively on mean-level change sometimes called Marginal Models
Those that emphasize individual change often do so through inclusion of Random Effects
often called “growth models”
